### TODO:

Cant fetch warehouse activities

Can create multiple PDT for the same Appointment (Possibly make appointment_id a PK)


### Questions:

(Done?) Ask about EntranceRequest, is it a good solution?

Do I need separated UUID in the PDT class if it is always 1-to-1 relationship?

ConveyorPayloadDumpHandler, is it a good naming?

Requests REST conventions

Extra table warehouse_activity_windows_activities, how to remove?

What is there are two appointments for the same tuck (license plate) for the same hour slot? Which one to take?
